**[Note]** This is a group project. Students may work in groups of 3 ~ 4 people, or by themselves.
  After completion, every group member submits their solutions on Autograder <mark>individually</mark>.

## Before We Start (Optional)

+ Read Textbook Ch. 4.4 carefully, especially the code listings
  from Fig. 4.37 to Fig. 4.44.
+ Read [CLRS](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/)
  Ch. 33.1 and 33.2 for an introduction to segment intersection.

## Introduction

![](assets/images/proj2/play.png)

In this project, we consider a classic problem in computational
geometry: Given a set of n line segments, identify an intersecting
pair, if one exists. The naive approach is to check all possible pairs
for intersection. That is, for every line segment check whether it
intersects with every other line segment. We can determine if two
lines intersect in $O(1)$ time, so this algorithm requires $O(n^2)$ time to
examine all pairs. A better approach is to use a Line Sweep Algorithm
([CLRS](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) Ch. 33.2),
which solves the problem in $O(n log(n))$ time.

A line segment is described by two endpoints, which we shall refer to
as the left endpoint (shown in green) and the right endpoint (shown in
red). In the first step of the algorithm, we sort all the endpoints by
their x-coordinates. This requires $O(n log(n))$ time in the worst
case. We then sweep a vertical line from left to right across the
plane. Each time the sweep line (shown as a dashed gray line) touches
an endpoint, the algorithm processes the event.

The main data structure is a binary search tree that, at any given
time, contains just those line segments that intersect the sweep
line. The segments are ordered in the tree according to the
y-coordinate of the point of where the segment intersects the sweep
line. For each endpoint the sweep line encounters as it passes across the plane, it
stops and takes one of the following actions depending on whether the
endpoint is green or red:

1. [green = left endpoint] Insert the line segment associated with
    this endpoint into the tree. Check for an intersection of this
    newly entered line segment with the one immediately above it on
    the sweep line. If they intersect, then highlight the two segments
    and stop. Otherwise, check for an intersection of this line segment with the
    one immediately below it on the sweep line. If they intersect,
    then highlight the two segments and stop. Otherwise, proceed with
    the sweep.

2. [red = right endpoint] Find the line segments immediately above and
    below this one on the sweep line. If they intersect, then
    highlight the two segments and stop. Otherwise, remove the line
    segment associated with this red endpoint from the tree and
    proceed with the sweep.

In the worst case, we need to process $O(n)$ endpoints. To achieve our
desired complexity of $O(n log(n))$, we need to process each endpoint in
$O(log(n))$ time. If we use a self-balancing binary search tree (such as
an AVL tree) to hold the line segments intersecting the sweep line,
then we can find the segments that are above and below a given segment
in $O(log(n))$ time.

## Submission

As usual, this project contains a programming part and a testing part.
You are expected to test your code locally as you develop the program.

+ Submit your code `AVLTree.java` and `BinarySearchTree.java` to [link](https://autograder.luddy.indiana.edu/web/project/1324).
+ Submit your test cases `StudentTest.java` to [link](https://autograder.luddy.indiana.edu/web/project/1322).
  * We have included a small test case in the support code to get you started.

Implementations of the GUI and the Line Sweep Algorithm are provided
to you in full in the
[student support code](https://github.com/IUDataStructuresCourse/segment-intersection-student-support-code).

Your task is to complete the implementation of the
`BinarySearchTree` and `AVLTree` class.
⚠️**You are NOT supposed to modify any code outside the two classes**
(marked as "read-only" in the project structure below).
Implement all of the methods marked `TODO` according to their descriptions
in the comments. **DO NOT** change their function signatures.

The `BinarySearchTree` class is an elaboration of the class described in
lecture and that you used in [Lab 4](./lab4).
The `AVLTree` class is a subclass of `BinarySeachTree` and
overrides the `insert()` and `remove()` methods to ensure that the tree remains
balanced at all times (which gives us the $O(log(n)$) time bound we crave).

Below is a summary of the components in the code base.
However, before you begin writing any code, you need to understand the
design of the interfaces in `OrderedSet.java`. So, that's the first place
you should look.

* `OrderedSet` [read-only] is an interface that describes the OrderedSet ADT
  through which the Line Sweep Algorithm will access the binary search tree. In
  this same file, you will find the interface definition for `Location`,
  which is used by `search()` to report the result of a
  look up. Furthermore, a `Location` must provide operations to access the
  previous and next elements with respect to inorder traversal,
  manifested by the `previous()` and `next()` methods. These methods
  are used by the Line Sweep Algorithm to determine the line segments
  that are immediately above or below the current segment.

* `BinarySearchTree` **[YOUR TASK]** is a generic class corresponding
  to a binary search tree. The ordering for the data in the tree
  is specified by a function of type `BiPredicate` and provided at
  construction time. Nodes in the tree are represented by the inner
  `Node` class. So that we can use `Node` as a return value from
  `search()`, `Node` implements the `Location` interface. A `Node`
  contains the usual fields: `key`, `left`, and `right`. You will add
  two more fields: `parent` (which points to the node's parent in the
  tree) and `height` (which is the height of the subtree rooted at
  this node).

* `AVLTree` **[YOUR TASK]** is a class representing a height-balanced tree. Since
  `AVLTree` is a subclass of `BinarySearchTree`, you will need a fully
  functioning implementation of `BinarySearchTree` before you can begin
  working on this class. However, this is the most interesting and
  important part of this entire project, so make sure you allow
  yourself enough time to work on it.

We can maintain the height information in the tree nodes so that it is
immediately available to us whenever we need it.
This means that when a new node is inserted or removed from the tree,
we may have to adjust the heights of the nodes along the path up to the root.

Each node maintains a pointer to its parent node. We will require this
information when implementing the `AVLTree`.
The root has no parent so its parent is `null`.

* `Constants` [read-only] is an interface containing a few global
  constants for the project.

* `Driver` [read-only] is the main entry for the project. This is where
  you go to launch the GUI, draw the line segments, and run the sweep
  algorithm.

* `GUI` [read-only] is the class that implements the graphical user
  interface.

* `LineSegment` [read-only] is a class that represents a line
  segment. In this same file, you will find class definitions for
  Endpoint (and its subclasses, LeftEndpoint and RightEndpoint), and
  the SweepLine.

* `Sweeper` [read-only] is the class that implements the Line Sweep
  Algorithm. Be sure to read through this code to help you understand
  how the algorithm works.

-----------------

* You have finally reached the end of the Project. Congratulations!
