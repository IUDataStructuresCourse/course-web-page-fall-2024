# Dynamic Programming

Overview
* purpose: solve optimization problems, that is find a solution that
  has the best metric among many feasible solutions
* recursive solutions to problems with optimial substructure
* memoization for problems with overlapping subproblems
* bottom-up memoization, which is called dynamic programming


## Definition of Optimization Problems

An **optimization problem** is a problem in which the goal is to find
an optimal solution among a set of feasible solutions.

**Example** Suppose you are preparing to hike the Appalachian Trail.
Select items from a grocery store that will fit in your backpack while
maximizing the number of calories.  You have room for 5 pounds of food
in your backpack and you are not allowed to split items. (This is the
0-1 Knapsack Problem.)

In general, an optimization problem defines a
* predicate that says which solutions are **feasible** and a
* **metric** that maps solutions to a number.

In the above knapsack problem, the
* feasible solutions are food selections up to 5 pounds and the
* metric is the sum of the calories in the selection.

## Optimal Substructure property

Some optimizations problems can be solved using a divide-and-conquer
strategy because they have a property called optimal substructure.

**Definition** A problem has *optimal substructure* if an optimal
solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of
subproblems.

The 0-1 Knapsack Problem has optimal substructure. Consider an optimal
solution for the 5 pound limit that consists of n items. If you remove
any one of the items, say a burrito weighing 1 pound, you have an
optimal solution for the subproblem of maximizing calories for 4
pounds.

## Dynamic Programming

The term **dynamic programming** was coined by Richard Bellman in 1950
as a way to describe his work to a US senator. Bellman was solving
optimization problems at RAND Corporation under contract with the Air
Force and came up with an efficient technique based on bottom-up
memoization.  The term "programming" was meant in the sense of
creating a plan (e.g. the "program" for an opera). The term "dynamic"
was chosen partialy because it sounded cool and partly because of its
connection to time-varying behaviour in physics.

## Example: The rod-cutting problem

Given 
1) a rod of length n and
2) a price function that maps rod-lengths (integers) to dollars, 

How should you cut up the rod to maximize the amount of money?

Example table:

	length: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
	price:  1  5  8  9 10 17 17 20 24 30

Let `p[i]` be the price for a continuous rod of length i
(the second row in the above table).

Let `r[n]` be the optimal total price for a rod of length n.

n | r[n]
--|----------------
0 | 0
1 | 1   (no cuts)
2 | 5   (no cuts)
3 | 8   (no cuts)
4 | 10 = p[2] + p[2]
5 | 13 = p[2] + p[3]
6 | 17  (no cuts)
7 | 18 = p[1] + p[6]
8 | 22 = p[2] + p[6]


### Recursive solution to rod cutting problem

For each possible first cut, recursively solve the rest, then take the
max of the possibilities.
	  
    r[n] = max of (p[i] + r[n-i]) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n

We define a class named `CutResult` to store the solution to
a subproblem. In this case, the location of the cut, the
cost, and a pointer to the solutions for the sub-subproblems.

```
class CutResult {
   CutResult(int c, int amt, CutResult r) { cut = c; cost = amt; rest = r; }
   int cut;
   int cost;
   CutResult rest;
}
```

The recursive function `cut_rod` implements this algorithm.

```
static CutResult cut_rod(int[] P, int n) {
   if (n == 0) { // base case
	  return new CutResult(0, 0, null);
   } else { // recursive
	  CutResult best_yet = null;
	  // try all possible choices of the next cut
	  for (int i = 1; i != n+1; ++i) {
	     // recursively solve the subproblem
		 CutResult rest = cut_rod(P, n - i);
		 // compute the metric based on this choice
		 int cost = P[i] + rest.cost;
		 // record the best choice so-far
		 if (best_yet == null || best_yet.cost < cost) {
			best_yet = new CutResult(i, cost, rest);
		 }
	  }
	  // Commit to the best choice as the solution
	  return best_yet;
   }
}
```

memoized version:

```
static CutResult cut_rod(int[] P, int n, CutResult[] R) {
   if (R[n] != null)
     return R[n];
   if (n == 0) { // base case
      CutResult res = new CutResult(0, 0, null);
      R[0] = res;
	  return res;
   } else { // recursive
	  CutResult best_yet = null;
	  // try all possible choices of the next cut
	  for (int i = 1; i != n+1; ++i) {
	     // recursively solve the subproblem
		 CutResult rest = cut_rod(P, n - i, R);
		 // compute the metric based on this choice
		 int cost = P[i] + rest.cost;
		 // record the best choice so-far
		 if (best_yet == null || best_yet.cost < cost) {
			best_yet = new CutResult(i, cost, rest);
		 }
	  }
	  // Commit to the best choice as the solution
	  R[n] = best_yet;
	  return best_yet;
   }
}
```


## Pattern for recursive solution to optimal substructure

1. figure out how to identify subproblems
   e.g., length of remaining rod to cut
2. base case handles smallest subproblems
   e.g., rod of length 0
3. recursive case
	a) try all possible choices of decomposing current problem into subproblems
	b) recursively solve the subproblems
	c) compute the metric based on each alternative
	d) choose the best one

## Overlapping Subproblems

Sometimes the same subproblems occur over and over.

Consider the problem tree (which corresponds to the procedure call
tree) for `cut_rod`. Notice that `cut_rod(0)` appears 10 times,
`cut_rod(1)` appears 6 times, `cut_rod(2)` appears 3 times, and
`cut_rod(3)` appears twice.

        cut_rod(5)
        |- cut_rod(4)
        |  |- cut_rod(3)
        |  |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(3)
        |  |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(0)

## Memoization (cache solutions)

1. Record each solution that you find.

2. Before computing a solution, first check to see if it has already
   been solved, and if so, just lookup the solution.


### Student exercise: implement a memoized version of cut_rod.

Solution:

```
static int cut_rod_memo(int[] P, int n) {
   CutResult[] R = new CutResult[n+1];
   return cut_rod_memo_aux(P, n, R).cost;
}

static CutResult cut_rod_memo_aux(int[] P, int n, CutResult[] R) {
   if (R[n] != null) {
	  return R[n];
   } else if (n == 0) {
	  R[n] = new CutResult(0, 0, null);
	  return R[n];
   } else {
	  CutResult best = null;
	  for (int i = 1; i != n+1; ++i) {
		 CutResult rest = cut_rod_memo_aux(P, n - i);
		 int cost = P[i] + rest.cost;
		 if (best == null || best.cost < cost) {
			best = new CutResult(i, cost, rest);
		 }
	  }
	  R[n] = best;
	  return best;
   }
}
```

## Dynamic Programming (Bottum Up)

What we've discussed so far is a recursive top-down approach.

We can also solve the subproblems in a bottom-up fashion.

Recall the problem tree for rod cutting:

        cut_rod(5)
        |- cut_rod(4)
        |  |- cut_rod(3)
        |  |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(3)
        |  |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(2)
        |  |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(1)
        |  |- cut_rod(0)
        |- cut_rod(0)


Note that problems only depend on subproblems with smaller rod length.

So we can start with rod length 0 (which has no dependencies) and then
proceed to longer rods.

```
static int cut_rod_dyn_prog(int[] P, int n) {
	CutResult[] R = new CutResult[n+1];
	// Solve the leaf problem
	R[0] = new CutResult(0, 0, null);
	// Solve the rest of the problems, bottom-up
	for (int j = 1; j != n+1; ++j) {
		CutResult best = null;
        // iterating over possible choices
		for (int i = 1; i != j+1; ++i) {
			CutResult rest = R[j - i];
			int cost = P[i] + rest.cost;
			if (best == null || best.cost < cost) {
				best = new CutResult(i, cost, rest);
			}
		}
		R[j] = best;
	}
	return R[n].cost;
}
```

The time complexity of `cut_rod_dyn_prog` is O(n²) because of the
double-nested loops.
   
## Recap: 

When to apply dynamic programming?

* The problem is an optimization problem, i.e., find the best solution
  among many possible solutions, and
* the problem has optimal substructure, and
* overlapping subproblems
	- The total number of subproblems needs to be
	  small (like polynomial) to make sure the space consumption
	  is reasonable.
	- There needs to be significant reuse of the subproblems
	  to make the memoization/table worthwhile.
	   
Develop a recursive solution and test correctness.

Change to memoized or bottom-up (dynamic programming) for efficiency.

Running time of dynamic programming depends on the number of
subproblems times the number of choices that need to be considered per
problem.

Consider the subproblem graph. The number of choices is the
out-degree and the number of subproblems is the number of vertices.
