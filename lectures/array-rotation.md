## Arrays in Java

Create an array of length `n`

```
int n = 10;
int[] A = new int[n];
```

Set the element at a given position:

```
A[0] = 0;
A[1] = 1;
A[2] = 4;

for (int i = 3; i != n; ++i)
  A[i] = i * i;
```

Now we have an array that looks like the following

    elements: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81
    position: 0, 1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9
	
Get the element at a given position:

```
assert A[2] == 4;
```

Loop over all the elements of an array, front to back

```
int total = 0;
for (int y : A) {
  total += y;
}
System.out.println(total);
```

Def. a *half-open interval*, written [i,k), is a contiguous subarray
that starts at position i and finishes one place before k.

The interval [3, 7) of our example array is

    elements: 9, 16, 25, 36
    position: 3,  4,  5,  6

Loop over a half-open interval of the subarray:

```
static int sum(int[] A, int begin, int end) {
  int total = 0;
  for (int i = begin; i != end; ++i) {
      total += A[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```

```
assert total == sum(A, 0, 5) + sum(A, 5, 10);
```

## Rotate the elements of an array by 1 to the right, with wrap around.

        [1,2,3,4,5]
	--> [5,1,2,3,4]
		
Rotation is used in
* sorting algorithms,
* text editors, e.g., when you drag-and-drop a chunk of text 
  to a new location.
* Discussed in "Programming Pearls" pp. 13-15, 209-211 by Jon Bentley
   (won the Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming award in 2004,
    Prof. at CMU whose students include Gosling (invented Java), Leiserson, 
    Later went to Bell Labs)
* also known as block-swapping, block exchange, section swap, vector rotation.

* Student exercise (5 minutes)

    Write down an algorithm for rotation.
	Apply the algorithm to the array, showing the array after each
    loop iteration.

* Go over student solutions to the array rotation. 
  They might look like one of the following. 

    * Save and shift

            [1,2,3,4,5]
            [1,2,3,4,-], 5    (put 5 off to the side)
            [-,1,2,3,4], 5    (move everything else to the right)
            [5,1,2,3,4]       (put 5 at the front)

        When moving everything to the right, should you go forwards
        or backwards?
        Answer: It's easier to go backwards.

            static void rotate_1_save_n_shift(int[] A) {
               if (A.length > 1) {
                  int last = A[A.length - 1];
                  for (int i=A.length - 1; i != 0; --i) {
                     A[i] = A[i-1];
                  }
                  A[0] = last;
               }
            }
        
    * Ripple from start (think of flapping a bedsheet)
      
            [1,2,3,4,5]
            [-,2,3,4,5],1
            [-,1,3,4,5],2
            [-,1,2,4,5],3
            [-,1,2,3,5],4
            [-,1,2,3,4],5
            [5,1,2,3,4]

      The algorithm puts `A[0]` into a temporary variable `tmp1`
      and then progressively swaps the next element with `tmp1`.

            static void rotate_1_ripple(int[] A) {
                if (A.length > 1) {
                    int tmp1 = A[0];
                    for (int i=0; i != A.length - 1; ++i) {
                        int tmp2 = A[i+1];
                        A[i+1] = tmp1;
                        tmp1 = tmp2;
                    }
                    A[0] = tmp1;
                }
            }
        
    * Ripple from start by swapping with A[0]
      
                               [1,2,3,4,5]
            [1,2,3,4,5]        [-,2,3,4,5],1
            [2,1,3,4,5]        [-,1,3,4,5],2
            [3,1,2,4,5]        [-,1,2,4,5],3
            [4,1,2,3,5]        [-,1,2,3,5],4
            [5,1,2,3,4]        [-,1,2,3,4],5
                               [-,1,2,3,4],5

        Instead of using a temporary variable, use `A[0]`.

            static void swap(int[] A, int i, int j) {
                int tmp = A[i];
                A[i] = A[j];
                A[j] = tmp;
            }

            static void rotate_1_ripple_swap(int[] A) {
                if (A.length > 1) {
                    for (int i = 1; i != A.length; ++i) {
                        swap(A, 0, i);
                    }
                }
            }
        
    * Swap backwards

      Swap the last two numbers, move one to the left and swap those two, etc.

            [1,2,3,4,5]
            [1,2,3,5,4]
            [1,2,5,3,4]
            [1,5,2,3,4]
            [5,1,2,3,4]
        
            static void rotate_1_swap_bkwd(int[] A) {
                if (A.length > 1) {
                   for (int i=A.length-1; i != 0; --i) {
                      swap(A, i, i-1);
                   }
                }
            }

## Testing

Let's pick one of the `rotate` implementations to test.  We'll create
a `Rotate.java` file in the `src` directory of our project.

```
public class Rotate {

    public static void rotate(int[] A) {
        rotate_1_swap_bkwd(A);
    }

    ...
}
```

To test the `rotate` method, we'll create a `RotateTest` class as
follows in a file named `RotateTest.java` in the `test` directory.
We'll need to import several items from the JUnit Jupiter library.

```
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class RotateTest {
   ...
}
```

### Testing Regular Cases

To get your bearings, its good to start with a test that captures the
common case and that you already know the solution, such as the
example above.

```
    @Test
    public void rotate_common_case() {
        try {
            int[] A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            int[] A_correct = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4};
            Rotate.rotate(A);
            assertArrayEquals(A, A_correct);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            fail(e.toString());
        }
    }
```

### Testing Corner Cases

In the code for `rotate_1_swap_bkwd`, there's a branch for length
greater than 1. So let's create tests that take different branches.

```
    @Test
    public void rotate_corner_cases() {
        // rotate an empty array
        try {
            int[] A = {};
            int[] A_correct = {};
            Rotate.rotate(A);
            assertArrayEquals(A, A_correct);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            fail(e.toString());
        }
		
        // rotate a 1-element array
        try {
            int[] A = {1};
            int[] A_correct = {1};
            Rotate.rotate(A);
            assertArrayEquals(A, A_correct);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            fail(e.toString());
        }

        // rotate a 2-element array
        try {
            int[] A = {1, 2};
            int[] A_correct = {2, 1};
            Rotate.rotate(A);
            assertArrayEquals(A, A_correct);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            fail(e.toString());
        }		
    }
```

### Testing Big Inputs using Random Input Generation

We'll need a way to check whether the `rotate` method did it's job.
We can do this by taking the specification for `rotate` and coding it
up as the following Java method `is_rotated` that takes two arrays, a
copy of the original one and the new one that was supposedly rotated.
It returns `true` if `A_new` is the rotated version of `A_orig`.

```
static boolean is_rotated(int[] A_orig, int[] A_new) {
	if (A_orig.length < 2) {
        return Arrays.equals(A_orig, A_new);
	} else {
		boolean result = A_new[0] == A_orig[A_orig.length - 1];
		for (int i = 0; i != A_orig.length - 1; ++i) {
			result = result && (A_orig[i] == A_new[i + 1]);
		}
		return result;
	}
}
```

Now we're ready to test `rotate` on arbitrary arrays.  We use the
standard Java random number generator to choose an array length and to
fill the array `A` with numbers. We then copy the array into `A_orig`,
apply `rotate` to `A`, and then check the result by calling
`is_rotated` with `A_orig` and `A`.


```
    @Test
    public void rotate_big() {
        // rotate a big, randomly generated array
		Random r = new Random(0);
		for (int t = 0; t != 50; ++t) {
			int n = r.nextInt(1000);
			int[] A = new int[n];
			for (int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
				A[i] = r.nextInt(100);
			}
			int[] A_orig = Arrays.copyOf(A, A.length);
			Rotate.rotate(A);
			assertTrue(is_rotated(A_orig, A));
		}
    }
```
