# Lab: Huffman Codeing

## Background and Overview

The lab is to finish a `Heap` class

## Support Code and Submission

+ Student support code is at [link](https://github.com/IUDataStructuresCourse/HuffmanCoding-student-support-code/).
+ Submit your code file `Heap.java` [link](https://autograder.luddy.indiana.edu/web/project/1310).
+ Submit your test file `StudentTest.java` [link](https://autograder.luddy.indiana.edu/web/project/1317).


## Problem Set

### Problem 1: Tree Traversal


### Problem 2: Testing

Write test cases in `StudentTest.java` with one method named `test()`.
This method should thoroughly test the `Heap` class.

Test and debug your own code from Problem 1 locally and then submit both your code
and your test cases to Autograder for grading.

The Autograder will apply your tests to buggy implementations of the
`Heap` class. You receive 1 point for each bug detected.
The Autograder will also apply your tests to a correct implementation
to rule out false positives.
